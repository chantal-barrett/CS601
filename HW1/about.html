                    <p>I love being out on the water. There is something about the freedom of the ocean and the salty air that just makes me so happy. My dad also enjoys being out on the water and decided to purchase a jet ski in 2013 so since then jet skiing has been one of my favorite summer activities. When I’m on the jet ski you can find me jumping waves or if it is a calm day and there are no waves to jump you can find me alongside big boats trying to jump their wake. I have taken a couple of falls of the jet ski before so it’s always important to remember to wear your life vest!</p>

                    <p>I started snowboarding a few years ago in 2017, right after I graduated college. I still take a couple of falls but I find it so much fun!  I would go up to Mount Snow almost every weekend where I learned how to hit rails, butter, tripod, and more! However, once I started graduate school in 2020, I had to shift my focus to schoolwork and now do not get to go snowboarding as often. I enjoy school though, as I have learned so much, yet my heart remains on the mountains.</p>

                    <p>I started longboarding shortly after I started snowboarding. I am not even close to being an expert at longboarding and can only travel a few feet before I get scared of falling. However, I still do enjoy it!</p>

                    <p>You can find me at the gym (almost) every morning at 6:00am, and sometimes if I’m caught up on homework, I go in the afternoon for a second time! I always enjoyed being active but would only do cardio at the gym as I was too intimidated to go into the weightlifting section. However, at the beginning of this year, my friend taught me how to lift and that has since become a new passion of mine. I would have to say leg day is my favorite day and chest day is a close second.</p>

                    <p>I enjoy golfing, although you probably only want me on your team if we’re playing best ball &#128512</p>
