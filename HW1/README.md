# Assignment One

A simple biography about myself.

## Description

This assignment uses only HTML5 to create a web site that gives an overview of myself. It consists of seven pages: a home page, an about page, a contact page, an expertise page, an accolades page, an education page, and an experience page. Each of the pages has a header, nav, footer, and an aside where users can quickly connect with me through LinkedIn, Git, or email. 

### How I Exceeded Requirements

In trying my best to get an A on this assigment, I added many supplemental features to my website including:
- 7 pages
- SVG for logo (CB) to reduce page load time and ensures a high quality image at any resolution 
- Multiple tables on multiple pages
- Multiple images on pages
- Multiple external hyperlinks
- Multiple lists on multiple pages
- Meta tags to help improve SEO
    - <meta charset="UTF-8"> to specify the character encoding used on my site. This is important to specify, as the wrong character encoding can cause some characters to display incorrectly in browsers.
    - <meta name="viewport"> to specify the visible area of each webpage. This is important for SEO, as this tag indicates to Google that the page is mobile-friendly and mobile-friendly web pages are ranked higher in search results.
    - <meta name="description"> to summarize each page's content. This is important, as search engines often use this to show in their search results.
    - <meta name="keywords"> to define keywords for search engines.
- A variety of new HTML5 semenatic elements
- Emojis
- 2+ paragraphs on pages
