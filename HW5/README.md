# Assignment Five

A website that fetches a JSON file.

## Description

This assignment uses HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript to create a web site that fetches a json file that contains the degrees I have recieved (note this JSON file only has two degrees, as I have only recieved a BS and am currently persuing my MS). 


### How I Exceeded Requirements

In trying my best to get an A on this assigment, I did the following:
- Styled the page using CSS and made it responsive
- Styled error messages written to the DOM
- Made error messages different depending on the response status
