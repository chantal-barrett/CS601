# Assignment Four

A form that submits user inputs.

## Description

This assignment uses HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript to create a web site with a form that asks the user to enter their first name, last name, facilitator, and select what they are inquiring about and their preferred method(s) of contact. The program validates that the user entered their name and a valid facilitator before submitting the form. 


### How I Exceeded Requirements

In trying my best to get an A on this assigment, I did the following:
- Styled the page using CSS and made it responsive
- Styled error messages written to the DOM
- Made error messages different depending on the user's input
- Validated input while the user is typing in addition to when the form is submitted
