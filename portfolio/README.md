# Portfolio

A portfolio website about myself.

## Description

This assignment uses HTML5, CSS and JavaScript to create a web site that gives an overview of myself. It currently consists of eight pages: a home page, an about page, a snowboarding page, a contact page, an expertise page, an accolades page, an education page, and an experience page. Each of the pages has a header, nav, footer, and an aside where users can quickly connect with me through LinkedIn, Git, or email. 

The website uses media queries to provide a different experience to users based on three different screen sizes. These screen size suggestions were taken from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-target-desktop-tablet-and-mobile-using-media-query/ where a width of 479.9px and below is used for mobile devices, 480px to 1023.9px is used for tablets, and a width of 1024px and above is used for desktop. I used media queries mainly to adjust content so it shows up in rows on desktop screen sizes and columns on smaller screen sizes. I also used media queries to apply transition effects on hover on desktop screen sizes (because on mobile and tablet devices, there is no hover).

### How I Exceeded Requirements

In trying my best to get an A on this assigment, I plan to add many supplemental features to my website including:
- 10 pages
- Researching CSS and JavaScript features not covered in class (i.e. scrolling behavior - note I still need to work out some issues on this page)
- Use different style sheets and JavaScript files to help organization and page performance, as there is no need to load files that aren't going to be used on a page
- Support for print layouts (removed empty space of heros that have background images, no scroll bar in nav)
- Create a contact form that adds users to a database along with their message. The plan is to implement a feature where they can subscribe/unsubscribe from emails by deleting their information from the database

### Questions for Facilitator
- What else can I do to improve this website to best exceed requirements?
- The nav is still a work in progress but what are your thoughts on an implementation like this?
- Thank you for taking the time to review this!!
