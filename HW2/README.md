# Assignment Two

A simple biography about myself.

## Description

This assignment uses only HTML5 and CSS to create a web site that gives an overview of myself. It consists of seven pages: a home page, an about page, a contact page, an expertise page, an accolades page, an education page, and an experience page. Each of the pages has a header, nav, footer, and an aside where users can quickly connect with me through LinkedIn, Git, or email. 

### How I Exceeded Requirements

In trying my best to get an A on this assigment, I added many supplemental features to my website including:
- Styled 7 pages
- Researched CSS features not covered in this weeks notes
