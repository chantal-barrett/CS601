# Assignment Two

A simple biography about myself.

## Description

This assignment uses only HTML5 and CSS to create a web site that gives an overview of myself. It consists of seven pages: a home page, an about page, a contact page, an expertise page, an accolades page, an education page, and an experience page. Each of the pages has a header, nav, footer, and an aside where users can quickly connect with me through LinkedIn, Git, or email. 

The website uses media queries to provide a different experience to users based on three different screen sizes. These screen size suggestions were taken from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-target-desktop-tablet-and-mobile-using-media-query/ where a width of 479.9px and below is used for mobile devices, 480px to 1023.9px is used for tablets, and a width of 1024px and above is used for desktop. I used media queries mainly to adjust content so it shows up in rows on desktop screen sizes and columns on smaller screen sizes. I also used media queries to apply transition effects on hover on desktop screen sizes (because on mobile and tablet devices, there is no hover).

### How I Exceeded Requirements

In trying my best to get an A on this assigment, I added many supplemental features to my website including:
- Styled 7 pages
- Researched CSS features not covered in this weeks notes
- For animations, I used a combination of transitions and keyframes
- For images, I used a combination of SVGs, images, and background images through CSS
- Used CSS variables to ensure the same color scheme throughout the website
- Used different style sheets to help organization and page performance, as there is no need to load CSS that isn't going to be used on a page
