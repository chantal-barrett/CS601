# Assignment Six

A website that uses Vue.js.

## Description

This assignment uses HTML5, CSS, Vue.js, and JavaScript to create a web site that changes images on hover. It also allows the user to guess the difference in years of those images. 


### How I Exceeded Requirements

In trying my best to get an A on this assigment, I did the following:
- Styled the page using CSS and made it responsive
- Added functionality where the user can guess the differences in years between the images
- Updated the DOM with the correct message depending on the user's guess

Note: The first time you hover on the image it may take a while to change, as the image is loaded on hover. I did this intentionally to help with page performace, however if I had more time I would consider a different implementation.
