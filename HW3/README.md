# Assignment Three

A calculator that adds two numbers.

## Description

This assignment uses HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript to create a web site that prompts the user to enter their name and two numbers. The program validates that the user entered their name and two valid numbers and then returns the sum of those two numbers. 


### How I Exceeded Requirements

In trying my best to get an A on this assigment, I added many supplemental features to this assignment including:
- Styled the page using CSS and made it responsive
- Used inputs and buttons with event listeners instead of always using prompts (even though I still included an alert and a prompt to meet the assignment requirements)
- Updated the DOM with the user's inputs (i.e. name and sum)
- Validated the user's inputs (name and numbers) and showed errors when needed

Please note, I had difficulty in distinguishing what met assignment requirements while also going above and beyond so in case this does not meet the assignment requirements, I included the files that should follow the exact flow of the assignment outline using alerts and prompts in the folder 'intitial'.
